## 1.2 Explain the importance of scoping and organizational/customer requirements
Proper scoping ensures that a security engagement is aligned with stakeholder expectations, avoids legal pitfalls, and delivers actionable results. It defines the **who, what, where, when, and how** of the test.
### üìê Standards and Methodologies
Leveraging recognized frameworks provides consistency, repeatability, and credibility.
| Standard/Methodology                     | Purpose in Scoping                                       |

### üìú Rules of Engagement
Rules of engagement define the **boundaries and limitations** to ensure ethical, legal, and safe testing.
| Factor                          | Description                                           |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Time of Day**                 | Avoid disruptions; match business hours or off-peak   |
| **Allowed/Disallowed Tests**    | E.g., no social engineering or DDoS attacks           |
| **Other Restrictions**          | Limitations on tools, access, or team involvement     |
### üß≠ Environmental Considerations
Understanding target environments helps customize test cases and tools.
| Environment       | Scoping Consideration                                   |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|

| **Cloud**         | Shared responsibility model, provider restrictions      |
### üéØ Target List / In-Scope Assets
Clearly defining in-scope assets ensures resources are tested responsibly and results are relevant.
| Asset Type                       | Scoping Value                                               |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Wireless Networks**            | SSIDs, encryption levels                                     |
| **IP Ranges**                    | Internal/external subnets, exclusions                        |
| **Domains**                      | Root domains, subdomains                                     |
| **APIs**                         | Endpoints, authentication scopes                             |
| **Physical Locations**           | Office sites, data centers                                   |
| **DNS**                          | Zones, records, redirect paths                               |
| **External vs. Internal Targets**| Internet-facing vs. inside perimeter                         |
| **First vs. Third-Party Hosted** | Cloud vendor platforms, outsourcing impacts                  |
### ‚úÖ Validate Scope of Engagement
Confirming scope is **critical to reduce misunderstandings, manage risk, and improve efficiency**.
| Action                                    | Objective                                                  |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Question the Client / Review Contracts** | Clarify expectations, gather permission                    |
| **Time Management**                      | Align testing with operational priorities                   |
| **Strategy**                             | Choose testing style: unknown vs. known environments         |
| **Unknown-environment Testing**          | Black-box methodology                                      |
| **Known-environment Testing**            | White-box or gray-box approach                             |

Scoping isn‚Äôt just paperwork‚Äîit‚Äôs the **foundation** of a successful cybersecurity assessment. Without clear boundaries, even the most sophisticated test can turn into a legal headache or a missed opportunity.
