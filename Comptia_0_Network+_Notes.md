# CompTIA Network+ Exam N10-009
# 1.0 Networking Concepts
## 1.1 Explain concepts related to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model
The **OSI model** is a conceptual framework developed by the **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)** to standardize networking protocols and promote interoperability between systems. It divides network communication into **seven distinct layers**, each with specific responsibilities.
### 🧱 The Seven Layers of the OSI Model
| Layer | Name         | Function Summary                                        | Example Protocols/Technologies             | Data Transfer Unit (DTU) | Devices/Hardware Examples            |
|-------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 7     | Application  | Interfaces directly with user applications              | HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS                        | Data                      | User Devices (PCs, Laptops), Servers |
| 6     | Presentation | Formats, encrypts, and compresses data for the session  | SSL/TLS, JPEG, MPEG                         | Data                      | Gateways                             |
| 5     | Session      | Manages sessions and dialog control between applications| NetBIOS, RPC                                | Data                      | Gateways, API Managers               |
| 4     | Transport    | Provides reliable data transfer, flow and error control | TCP, UDP                                    | Segments                  | Load Balancers, Routers              |
| 3     | Network      | Handles routing and addressing across networks          | IP, ICMP, IPSec, ARP                        | Packets                   | Routers, Layer 3 Switches            |
| 2     | Data Link    | Transfers frames between nodes and handles MAC addressing| Ethernet, PPP, MAC, VLAN                    | Frames                    | Switches, Bridges, Network Cards     |
| 1     | Physical     | Transmits raw bits over a physical medium               | Cables, Hubs, Fiber Optics, Modems          | Bits                      | Hubs, Repeaters, NICs, Modems        |
### 1. Physical Layer
- Deals with **hardware transmission** of raw bits.
- Includes cables, connectors, voltage levels, and timing.
### 2. Data Link Layer
- Responsible for **node-to-node data transfer**.
- Handles **framing**, **MAC addressing**, and **error detection** (e.g., CRC).
### 3. Network Layer
- Manages **logical addressing** and **routing**.
- Determines the best path for data to travel across networks.
### 4. Transport Layer
- Ensures **complete data transfer** with **error recovery** and **flow control**.

Cabling and physical interfaces are foundational to network connectivity. Misconfigurations or hardware faults can lead to degraded performance or complete outages.
### 🧵 Cable Issues
#### 🔌 Incorrect Cable Type
- **Single Mode vs. Multimode Fiber**:
  - Single mode: Long-distance, narrow core, laser-based.
  - Multimode: Short-distance, wider core, LED-based.
  - **Impact**: Mismatched fiber types cause signal loss or failure.
- **Category 5/6/7/8**:
  - Higher categories support faster speeds and longer distances.
  - **Impact**: Using lower category cables can limit performance or fail to meet standards.
- **STP vs. UTP**:
  - STP: Shielded to reduce interference.
  - UTP: Unshielded, more flexible and cost-effective.
  - **Impact**: Using UTP in high-interference environments can lead to signal degradation.
#### 📉 Signal Degradation
- **Crosstalk**: Signal leakage between adjacent wires.
- **Interference**: External electromagnetic sources disrupt signal.

- **Impact**: Link failures, degraded performance.
## 5.3 Given a scenario, troubleshoot common issues with network services
Network services are critical for connectivity and performance. Misconfigurations or failures in switching, routing, and addressing can lead to outages or degraded service.
### 🔀 Switching Issues
#### 🌐 STP (Spanning Tree Protocol)
Used to prevent network loops in Layer 2 networks.
##### 🔁 Common STP Problems
- **Network Loops**: Occur when STP is disabled or misconfigured, causing broadcast storms.
- **Root Bridge Selection**: Incorrect root bridge can lead to suboptimal paths.
- **Port Roles**:
  - Root Port: Best path to root bridge.
  - Designated Port: Forwarding port for a segment.
  - Blocked Port: Prevents loops.
- **Port States**:
  - Listening → Learning → Forwarding → Blocking.
  - Misconfigured states can prevent traffic flow.
#### 🎨 Incorrect VLAN Assignment
- Devices placed in wrong VLANs may lose connectivity or access unauthorized resources.
- **Impact**: Segmentation failure, security risks, communication issues.
#### 📜 ACLs (Access Control Lists)
- Misconfigured ACLs can block legitimate traffic or allow unauthorized access.
- **Impact**: Connectivity issues, security breaches.
### 🧭 Route Selection
#### 📘 Routing Table
- Contains paths to destination networks.
- **Issues**:
  - Missing or incorrect entries.
  - Conflicting routes.
#### 🛣️ Default Routes
- Used when no specific route matches a destination.
- **Impact**: Incorrect default route can prevent internet or external network access.
### 🧮 Addressing Issues
#### 🚫 Address Pool Exhaustion
- DHCP scope runs out of available IP addresses.
- **Impact**: Devices fail to obtain IP, resulting in limited or no connectivity.
#### ❌ Incorrect Default Gateway
- Devices can't reach external networks.
- **Impact**: Internet and inter-subnet communication fails.
#### 🧭 Incorrect IP Address
- **Static Misconfiguration**: Wrong IP manually assigned.
- **Impact**: Network conflicts or isolation.
#### ⚠️ Duplicate IP Address
- Two devices share the same IP.
- **Impact**: Intermittent connectivity, ARP conflicts.
#### 📏 Incorrect Subnet Mask
- Devices miscalculate network boundaries.
- **Impact**: Inability to communicate with intended hosts.
