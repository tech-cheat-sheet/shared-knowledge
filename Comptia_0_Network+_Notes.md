# 1.0 Networking Concepts
## 1.1 Explain concepts related to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model
The **OSI model** is a conceptual framework developed by the **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)** to standardize networking protocols and promote interoperability between systems. It divides network communication into **seven distinct layers**, each with specific responsibilities.
### 🧱 The Seven Layers of the OSI Model
| Layer | Name               | Function Summary                                      | Example Protocols/Technologies          |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 7     | Application        | Interfaces directly with user applications             | HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS                    |
| 6     | Presentation       | Translates data formats, encryption, compression       | SSL/TLS, JPEG, MPEG                     |
| 5     | Session            | Manages sessions between applications                  | NetBIOS, RPC                            |
| 4     | Transport          | Ensures reliable data transfer, error recovery         | TCP, UDP                                |
| 3     | Network            | Routes data between devices across networks            | IP, ICMP, IPsec                         |
| 2     | Data Link          | Handles error detection/correction in physical transfer| Ethernet, PPP, MAC                      |
| 1     | Physical           | Transmits raw bit stream over physical medium          | Cables, Hubs, Modems, Fiber optics      |
### 1. Physical Layer
- Deals with **hardware transmission** of raw bits.
- Includes cables, connectors, voltage levels, and timing.
### 2. Data Link Layer
- Responsible for **node-to-node data transfer**.
- Handles **framing**, **MAC addressing**, and **error detection** (e.g., CRC).
### 3. Network Layer
- Manages **logical addressing** and **routing**.
- Determines the best path for data to travel across networks.
### 4. Transport Layer
