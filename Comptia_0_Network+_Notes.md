# 1.0 Networking Concepts
## 1.1 Explain concepts related to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model
The **OSI model** is a conceptual framework developed by the **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)** to standardize networking protocols and promote interoperability between systems. It divides network communication into **seven distinct layers**, each with specific responsibilities.
### 🧱 The Seven Layers of the OSI Model
| Layer | Name               | Function Summary                                      | Example Protocols/Technologies          |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 7     | Application        | Interfaces directly with user applications             | HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS                    |
| 6     | Presentation       | Translates data formats, encryption, compression       | SSL/TLS, JPEG, MPEG                     |
| 5     | Session            | Manages sessions between applications                  | NetBIOS, RPC                            |
| 4     | Transport          | Ensures reliable data transfer, error recovery         | TCP, UDP                                |
| 3     | Network            | Routes data between devices across networks            | IP, ICMP, IPsec                         |
| 2     | Data Link          | Handles error detection/correction in physical transfer| Ethernet, PPP, MAC                      |
| 1     | Physical           | Transmits raw bit stream over physical medium          | Cables, Hubs, Modems, Fiber optics      |
### 1. Physical Layer
- Deals with **hardware transmission** of raw bits.
- Includes cables, connectors, voltage levels, and timing.
### 2. Data Link Layer
- Responsible for **node-to-node data transfer**.
- Handles **framing**, **MAC addressing**, and **error detection** (e.g., CRC).
### 3. Network Layer
- Manages **logical addressing** and **routing**.
- Determines the best path for data to travel across networks.
### 4. Transport Layer
- Ensures **complete data transfer** with **error recovery** and **flow control**.
- TCP provides reliable delivery; UDP is faster but less reliable.
### 5. Session Layer
- Establishes, maintains, and terminates **sessions** between applications.
- Coordinates communication and manages **dialog control**.
### 6. Presentation Layer
- Translates data between **application and network formats**.
- Handles **encryption**, **compression**, and **serialization**.
### 7. Application Layer
- Closest to the user; provides **network services** to applications.
- Examples include web browsers, email clients, and file transfer tools.
### 🧠 Why It Matters
- **Modularity**: Each layer can evolve independently.
- **Interoperability**: Devices from different vendors can communicate.
- **Troubleshooting**: Helps isolate network issues by layer.
## 1.2 Compare and contrast networking appliances, applications, and functions.
Networking components can be deployed as **physical hardware** or **virtual software-based solutions**. Each serves a specific role in managing, securing, and optimizing network traffic and resources.
### 🧱 Physical vs. Virtual Appliances
