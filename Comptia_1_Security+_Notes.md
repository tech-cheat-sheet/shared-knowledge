# CompTIA Security+ Exam SY0-701
# 1.0 General Security Concepts
## 1.1 Compare and contrast various types of security controls
Security controls are mechanisms used to reduce risk, protect assets, and ensure compliance. They are categorized by how they are implemented and the purpose they serve.
### 📂 Categories of Security Controls
| Category     | Description | Examples |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| **Technical** | Implemented via hardware/software | Firewalls, antivirus, encryption, access controls |
| **Managerial** | Defined by policies and procedures | Risk assessments, security policies, audits |
| **Operational** | Day-to-day practices and processes | Security awareness training, incident response |
| **Physical** | Protect physical access to systems | Locks, cameras, fences, biometric scanners |
### 🧭 Types of Security Controls
| Control Type   | Purpose | Examples |
|----------------|--------|----------|
| **Preventive** | Stops incidents before they occur | Firewalls, access control lists, encryption |
| **Deterrent**  | Discourages malicious activity | Warning signs, security cameras, policies |
| **Detective**  | Identifies and alerts on incidents | IDS/IPS, audit logs, CCTV monitoring |
| **Corrective** | Restores systems after an incident | Backup restoration, patching, reconfiguration |
| **Compensating** | Alternative control when primary is not feasible | Manual reviews, additional monitoring |
| **Directive**  | Guides behavior and actions | Security policies, training, procedures |
### 🔍 Summary
- **Technical vs. Operational**: Technical controls are automated, while operational controls rely on human actions.

| **Lighting**             | Enhances visibility and deters intruders |
| **Sensors**              | Detect unauthorized access |
#### 🔍 Sensor Types
- **Infrared**: Detects heat signatures
- **Pressure**: Detects weight or movement
- **Microwave**: Detects motion via wave disruption
- **Ultrasonic**: Detects movement using sound waves
### 🕵️ Deception and Disruption Technologies
| Technology     | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Honeypot**   | Decoy system to attract attackers |
| **Honeynet**   | Network of honeypots simulating a full environment |
| **Honeyfile**  | Fake file used to detect unauthorized access |
| **Honeytoken** | Embedded data that triggers alerts when accessed |
## 1.3 Explain the importance of change management processes and the impact to security
Change management ensures that modifications to systems, applications, and infrastructure are planned, tested, and documented to minimize risk and maintain security posture.
### 🏢 Business Processes Impacting Security Operations
Effective change management aligns technical changes with business goals while safeguarding operations.
| Element              | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Approval Process** | Ensures changes are reviewed and authorized by appropriate personnel |
| **Ownership**        | Assigns responsibility for implementing and maintaining changes |
| **Stakeholders**     | Involves relevant parties (e.g., IT, security, compliance) in decision-making |
| **Impact Analysis**  | Assesses potential effects on systems, users, and security |
| **Test Results**     | Validates that changes work as intended without introducing vulnerabilities |
| **Backout Plan**     | Provides a rollback strategy in case of failure |
| **Maintenance Window** | Schedules changes during low-impact periods to reduce disruption |
