# CompTIA Security+ Exam SY0-701
# 1.0 General Security Concepts
## 1.1 Compare and contrast various types of security controls
Security controls are mechanisms used to reduce risk, protect assets, and ensure compliance. They are categorized by how they are implemented and the purpose they serve.
### üìÇ Categories of Security Controls
| Category     | Description | Examples |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| **Technical** | Implemented via hardware/software | Firewalls, antivirus, encryption, access controls |
| **Managerial** | Defined by policies and procedures | Risk assessments, security policies, audits |
| **Operational** | Day-to-day practices and processes | Security awareness training, incident response |
| **Physical** | Protect physical access to systems | Locks, cameras, fences, biometric scanners |
### üß≠ Types of Security Controls
| Control Type   | Purpose | Examples |
|----------------|--------|----------|
| **Preventive** | Stops incidents before they occur | Firewalls, access control lists, encryption |
| **Deterrent**  | Discourages malicious activity | Warning signs, security cameras, policies |
| **Detective**  | Identifies and alerts on incidents | IDS/IPS, audit logs, CCTV monitoring |
| **Corrective** | Restores systems after an incident | Backup restoration, patching, reconfiguration |
| **Compensating** | Alternative control when primary is not feasible | Manual reviews, additional monitoring |
| **Directive**  | Guides behavior and actions | Security policies, training, procedures |
### üîç Summary
- **Technical vs. Operational**: Technical controls are automated, while operational controls rely on human actions.
- **Preventive vs. Detective**: Preventive stops threats; detective identifies them after they occur.
- **Corrective vs. Compensating**: Corrective fixes issues; compensating fills gaps when ideal controls aren't possible.
- **Directive vs. Deterrent**: Directive instructs; deterrent discourages.
