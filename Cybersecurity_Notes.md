# Information Security
## Principles of Security = Security Concepts + Security Controls
### Security Concepts = CIA + AAA
- **Confidentiality** ensures that only authorized parties can
view the information.
- **Integrity** ensures that the information is correct and no unauthorized person or malicious software has altered the data.
- **Availability** ensures that data is accessible to only authorized users and not to unapproved individuals.
- **Authentication** Checking the delivery person‚Äôs credentials to be sure that they are authentic and not fabricated.
- **Authorization** granting permission to take an action. Computer users are granted access only to the specific services, devices,applications, and files needed to perform their job duties.
- **Accounting** creates a record that is preserved of who accessed the enterprise network, what resources they accessed, and when they disconnected from the network.
### Security Controls
A security control is a safeguard (sometimes called a countermeasure) that is employed within an enterprise to protect
the CIA of information. A control attempts to limit the exposure of an asset to a danger.
#### Security Control Categories

## üîç Real-World Analogy
- Threat Vector: Like a burglar choosing a window to break in.
- Vulnerability Type: The fact that the window was left unlocked.
## üß© How They Interact
- A threat vector exploits a vulnerability type. For example:
- A phishing email (threat vector) may exploit insecure authentication (vulnerability type).
- A malicious website (threat vector) may exploit a cross-site scripting flaw (vulnerability type).
# MITRE ATT&CK¬Æ framework
a globally accessible knowledge base that catalogs the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by cyber adversaries based on real-world observations2.
## üîç What does ATT&CK stand for?
- Adversarial
- Tactics
- Techniques
- &
- Common
- Knowledge
## üß† Key Features of MITRE ATT&CK:
- Models attacker behavior from the attacker‚Äôs perspective, not the defender‚Äôs
- Helps organizations detect, prevent, and respond to cyber threats
- Continuously updated with input from cybersecurity professionals worldwide
- Used by security teams, threat hunters, red teams, and penetration testers
## üìä Structure of the Framework: 
MITRE ATT&CK is organized into matrices for different environments:
| Matrix     | Focus Area                                                       |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enterprise | Windows, macOS, Linux, cloud, containers, and network infrastructure |
| Mobile     | Android and iOS                                                  |
| ICS        | Industrial Control Systems (e.g., utilities, factories)          |

Each matrix includes:
- Tactics: The attacker‚Äôs goals (e.g., Initial Access, Persistence, Exfiltration)
- Techniques: How those goals are achieved (e.g., Phishing, Credential Dumping)
- Sub-techniques: More granular methods within a technique

üí° Why it matters: MITRE ATT&CK helps organizations understand how attackers operate, simulate attacks, and strengthen defenses. It‚Äôs like a playbook of how cyber adversaries think and act.

## MITRE ATT&CK¬Æ framework
## üß© Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain
- Breaks down cyberattacks into seven linear stages: Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, Command & Control, and Actions on Objectives
- Focuses on early detection and prevention
- Best for training and understanding attack progression
- Limitation: Less effective for post-compromise detection and modern, multi-vector attacks
## üíé Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis
- Emphasizes four core components: Adversary, Infrastructure, Capability, and Victim
- Useful for threat attribution and understanding attacker motivations
- Often used in threat intelligence and APT analysis
- Can be combined with MITRE ATT&CK for deeper insights
## üìö NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
- Structured around five core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover
- Focuses on risk management and governance
- Widely adopted across industries for compliance and strategic planning
- Less tactical than ATT&CK; more about policy and process alignment
## üß† CAPEC (Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification)
- Catalogs known attack patterns, especially for application-level threats
- Often paired with CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)
- Ideal for secure software development and penetration testing
- Less suited for real-time threat detection
## üîê STRIDE Threat Modeling
- Developed by Microsoft; focuses on six threat categories: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege
- Great for design-phase threat modeling
- Often used in secure architecture reviews

## üß† Quick Insight
- SOC is your digital fire brigade üöí
- Vulnerability Management is your building inspector üèóÔ∏è
- Threat Intelligence is your neighborhood watch üëÅÔ∏è
## üß† Why Threat Intelligence Matters in Vulnerability Management
- Helps prioritize vulnerabilities based on real-world exploitability
- Adds context to CVEs (e.g., is it actively exploited in the wild?)
- Enables risk-based remediation instead of patching everything blindly
- Supports faster response to zero-day threats and emerging campaigns
## üîç How the Big Three Integrate Threat Intelligence
| Platform           | Threat Intelligence Integration                                                              |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Qualys VMDR**    | Uses TruRisk scoring powered by 25+ threat feeds; integrates with MITRE ATT&CK and CISA KEV |
| **Tenable One**    | Offers Vulnerability Priority Rating (VPR) using exploitability data, threat feeds, and asset context |
| **Rapid7 InsightVM** | Uses Real Risk Score based on threat intel, CVSS, and asset criticality; integrates with Metasploit for exploit validation |
## üìä What This Means for You
- These platforms don‚Äôt just scan‚Äîthey analyze threat data to tell you which vulnerabilities are most dangerous.
- They help security teams focus on the 3‚Äì5% of vulnerabilities that truly matter, reducing noise and improving efficiency.

So yes, threat intelligence is baked into the DNA of modern vulnerability scanners‚Äîand if a tool doesn‚Äôt offer it, it‚Äôs falling behind.

| Confidential     | Highest level of data sensitivity                                                | Only accessible by users with the highest level of preapproved authentication                 |
| Private          | Medium confidentiality; access should be limited                                | Available only to users with a need-to-know basis                                              |
| Sensitive        | Disclosure could cause catastrophic harm                                         | Restricted to employees with business need and formal approval                                |
| Critical         | Essential for organizational functionality; must be available                    | Must be rigorously protected to maintain availability and mission                             |
| Public           | No risk associated with release                                                  | Accessible by all; assumed public if no other data label is present                           |
| Restricted       | Not available to the public                                                      | Exercise caution before using in emails or external communications                            |
## Types of Data
- **Regulated** is that which external stipulations are placed on it regarding who can see and use the data and in what contexts. Examples of regulated data include Protected Health Information (PHI), which is data about a person‚Äôs health status, provision of healthcare, or payment for healthcare, and is regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Account- ability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).
- **Intellectual property (IP)** is an invention or a work that is the result of creativity. The owner of IP can apply for protection from others who attempt to duplicate it;
these protections over IP or its expression are patent, trademark, copyright, or trade secret.
- **Trade secret** is enterprise data that is undisclosed. A trade secret has three
elements: it is information that has either actual or potential independent economic value by
virtue of not being generally known, it has value to others who cannot legitimately obtain the
information, and it is subject to reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy. All three of these
¬≠elements are required and, if any one of them ceases to exist, then the trade secret will also
cease to exist. Otherwise, there is no limit on the amount of time a trade secret is protected.
## States of Data
- **Data in processing** Data in use (also called data in processing) is data on which actions are
being performed by devices, such as printing a report from a device.
- **Data in transit** Actions that transmit the data across a network, like an email sent across the
Internet, are called data in transit (sometimes called data in motion).
- **Data at rest** \is data that is stored on electronic media.
