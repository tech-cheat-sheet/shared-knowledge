| **Mitigation**        | Block or monitor attack paths                          | Patch or fix the underlying flaw                         |
## 🔍 Real-World Analogy
- Threat Vector: Like a burglar choosing a window to break in.
- Vulnerability Type: The fact that the window was left unlocked.
## 🧩 How They Interact
- A threat vector exploits a vulnerability type. For example:
- A phishing email (threat vector) may exploit insecure authentication (vulnerability type).
- A malicious website (threat vector) may exploit a cross-site scripting flaw (vulnerability type).
# MITRE ATT&CK® framework
a globally accessible knowledge base that catalogs the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by cyber adversaries based on real-world observations2.
## 🔍 What does ATT&CK stand for?
- Adversarial
- Tactics
- Techniques
- &
- Common
- Knowledge
## 🧠 Key Features of MITRE ATT&CK:
- Models attacker behavior from the attacker’s perspective, not the defender’s
- Helps organizations detect, prevent, and respond to cyber threats
- Continuously updated with input from cybersecurity professionals worldwide
- Used by security teams, threat hunters, red teams, and penetration testers
## 📊 Structure of the Framework: 
MITRE ATT&CK is organized into matrices for different environments:
| Matrix     | Focus Area                                                       |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enterprise | Windows, macOS, Linux, cloud, containers, and network infrastructure |
| Mobile     | Android and iOS                                                  |
| ICS        | Industrial Control Systems (e.g., utilities, factories)          |

Each matrix includes:
- Tactics: The attacker’s goals (e.g., Initial Access, Persistence, Exfiltration)
- Techniques: How those goals are achieved (e.g., Phishing, Credential Dumping)
- Sub-techniques: More granular methods within a technique

💡 Why it matters: MITRE ATT&CK helps organizations understand how attackers operate, simulate attacks, and strengthen defenses. It’s like a playbook of how cyber adversaries think and act.

# Cybersecurity Frameworks
## MITRE ATT&CK® framework
## 🧩 Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain
- Breaks down cyberattacks into seven linear stages: Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, Command & Control, and Actions on Objectives
- Focuses on early detection and prevention
- Best for training and understanding attack progression
- Limitation: Less effective for post-compromise detection and modern, multi-vector attacks
## 💎 Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis
- Emphasizes four core components: Adversary, Infrastructure, Capability, and Victim
- Useful for threat attribution and understanding attacker motivations
- Often used in threat intelligence and APT analysis
- Can be combined with MITRE ATT&CK for deeper insights
## 📚 NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
- Structured around five core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover
- Focuses on risk management and governance
- Widely adopted across industries for compliance and strategic planning
- Less tactical than ATT&CK; more about policy and process alignment
## 🧠 CAPEC (Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification)
- Catalogs known attack patterns, especially for application-level threats
- Often paired with CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)
- Ideal for secure software development and penetration testing
- Less suited for real-time threat detection
## 🔐 STRIDE Threat Modeling
- Developed by Microsoft; focuses on six threat categories: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege
- Great for design-phase threat modeling
- Often used in secure architecture reviews
- Can be mapped to ATT&CK for more granular analysis
## 🧪 Unified Kill Chain
- Combines elements of Cyber Kill Chain and MITRE ATT&CK
- Offers a more holistic view of attacker behavior across multiple campaigns
- Useful for advanced threat hunting and defense-in-depth strategies
## 🛠️ PASTA, DREAD, and OCTAVE
- These are risk-centric threat modeling frameworks
- Focus on impact analysis, likelihood scoring, and business risk
- Often used in enterprise risk assessments and DevSecOps pipelines

| MITRE ATT&CK                  | Highly respected in threat intelligence and red teaming; integrated into many security tools |
## 🧠 Why These Stand Out
- NIST CSF is flexible and scalable, making it ideal for organizations of all sizes.
- ISO 27001 offers formal certification, which boosts trust and compliance.
- PCI DSS and HIPAA are regulatory must-haves in finance and healthcare.
- SOC 2 is often a deal-breaker for B2B tech companies.
- GDPR has global influence—even non-EU companies must comply.
- MITRE ATT&CK is the go-to for understanding attacker behavior and mapping defenses.
