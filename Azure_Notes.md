# Microsoftâ€™s ELK-Like Stack
ELK Component|Microsoft Equivalent|Description
-----|-----|-----
Elasticsearch|Azure Data Explorer (ADX)Log Analytics|Fast, scalable search and analytics engine for telemetry and logs.
Logstash|Azure Monitor / Diagnostic Settings / Event Hubs|Collects and routes logs from various sources.
Kibana|Azure Monitor Workbooks / Dashboards|Visualizes metrics, logs, and traces with customizable dashboards.

# For Security & SIEM Use Cases
Microsoft Sentinel A cloud-native SIEM and SOAR platform that ingests logs, detects threats, and automates responses. Itâ€™s tightly integrated with Azure services and supports custom queries using Kusto Query Language (KQL)â€”similar to Elasticsearchâ€™s DSL.

# ðŸ§° Other Useful Tools
- Application Insights: Performance monitoring for apps, with telemetry and tracing.
- Azure Monitor Logs: Centralized log storage and querying.
- Azure Metrics Explorer: Real-time metrics visualization.
- Power BI: For advanced reporting and data visualization.

Microsoftâ€™s stack is more integrated and managed, while ELK offers more flexibility and control. If you're already in the Azure ecosystem, using Sentinel + Monitor + ADX gives you powerful observability and security capabilities without the overhead of managing ELK infrastructure.
