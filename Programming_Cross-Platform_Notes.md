# Electron vs .NET MAUI
Electron and .NET MAUI are both powerful frameworks for building cross-platform apps‚Äîbut they take very different paths to get there. Here‚Äôs a breakdown to help you compare:
## üß± Architecture & Tech Stack
- Electron: Uses JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and optionally TypeScript. It wraps web apps in a desktop shell using Chromium and Node.js.
- .NET MAUI: Uses C# and XAML to build native apps for Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS. It‚Äôs part of the .NET ecosystem and compiles to native code.
## üñ•Ô∏è Platform Support
| Framework   | Desktop (Win/macOS/Linux) | Mobile (iOS/Android) |
|-------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Electron    | ‚úÖ Yes                    | ‚ùå No                |
| .NET MAUI   | ‚úÖ Yes                    | ‚úÖ Yes               |
## ‚öôÔ∏è Performance
- Electron: Runs inside a Chromium browser shell, which adds overhead. Apps can be heavier and slower for resource-intensive tasks.
- .NET MAUI: Compiles to native code, offering better performance and smaller app sizes.
## üé® UI & Native Features
- Electron: UI is built with web technologies. Native features (like file system access or notifications) require Node.js modules or custom bridges.
- .NET MAUI: Offers native UI components and direct access to platform APIs like camera, sensors, and storage.
## üß© Ecosystem & Community
- Electron: Huge community, tons of tutorials, and used by apps like Slack, Discord, and VS Code.
- .NET MAUI: Newer and still growing. Backed by Microsoft, but has fewer resources and examples available.
## üì¶ App Size & Deployment
- Electron: Bundles Chromium and Node.js, so apps can be 100MB+ even for simple tools.
- .NET MAUI: Native compilation means leaner binaries, especially for mobile.

If you're building a desktop-only app with a web-like UI, Electron might be the smoother ride. But if you want native performance across desktop and mobile, .NET MAUI is the heavyweight contender.
# Electron vs Docker
# üß† What They Each Do
- Electron: Lets you build cross-platform desktop apps using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS). Think of it as a way to write one UI codebase and run it on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Docker: Provides cross-platform deployment environments by packaging apps into containers. These containers run consistently across different systems, regardless of the host OS.
## üîç Key Differences
| Feature           | Electron                                | Docker                                      |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Purpose           | Build desktop apps                       | Package and run any app in containers       |
| Tech Stack        | JavaScript, HTML, CSS (via Chromium)     | Any language (Go, Python, Node, etc.)       |
| UI Support        | Yes (desktop GUI)                        | No (headless or CLI apps)                   |
| Platform Target   | Windows, macOS, Linux (GUI)              | Windows, macOS, Linux (server/client)       |
| Use Case          | Slack, VS Code, Discord                  | Backend services, microservices, CI/CD      |
## üß© How They Might Intersect
You can technically run an Electron app inside a Docker container‚Äîfor example, for testing or development‚Äîbut it‚Äôs not ideal for production. Docker doesn‚Äôt natively support GUI apps, and running Electron in a container requires extra setup (like X11 forwarding or virtual display servers)2.

So while they both offer cross-platform benefits, Electron is about user-facing apps, and Docker is about environment consistency and deployment.
