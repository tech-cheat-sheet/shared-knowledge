# ArgoCD
ArgoCD is a declarative GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes ‚Äî meaning it automates how applications are deployed and kept in sync with their desired state, as defined in a Git repository2.
## ‚öôÔ∏è ArgoCD Capabilities Overview
| Capability               | Description                                                                  |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **GitOps Deployment**     | Uses Git as the single source of truth for app configurations                |
| **Continuous Sync**       | Monitors live Kubernetes state and syncs it with Git-defined desired state   |
| **Rollback Support**      | Easily revert to previous versions stored in Git                             |
| **Multi-Cluster Management** | Deploy and manage apps across multiple Kubernetes clusters             |
| **Visual Dashboard**      | Web UI to view app health, sync status, and deployment history               |
| **CLI & API Access**      | Automate workflows via command line or REST/gRPC APIs                        |
| **Templating Support**    | Works with Helm, Kustomize, Jsonnet, and plain YAML                          |
## üß† How It Works
1. You define your app‚Äôs desired state (manifests, Helm charts, etc.) in a Git repo.
2. ArgoCD continuously compares that state to what‚Äôs running in your cluster.
3. If there‚Äôs a mismatch (called OutOfSync), it can automatically or manually sync the cluster to match Git.
4. All changes are tracked, auditable, and version-controlled.
## üîß Use Cases
- Automating deployments in CI/CD pipelines
- Preventing configuration drift
- Managing multi-tenant Kubernetes environments
- Enabling secure, auditable infrastructure changes
