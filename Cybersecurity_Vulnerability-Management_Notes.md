# Categories of vulnerabilities
1. Software
2. Hardware
  - Difficulty Patching Firmware Firmware is software that is embedded into hardware. It provides low-level
controls and instructions for the hardware. Updating firmware to address a vulnerability contained in its code can be
difficult and requires specialized steps. Not all firmware can be patched with security updates. As a result, firmware
with a vulnerability can be a target for attackers.
  - Legacy Platforms One type of platform that is well known for its vulnerabilities is a legacy platform. A legacy
platform is an older hardware platform for which a more modern version is available but for a variety of reasons has
not been updated or replaced. These reasons may include limited hardware capacity, an application that only operates
on an outdated OS version, or even neglect. The result is that the hardware legacy platform has been deprived of the
most recent security fixes. This creates hardware that is just asking to be attacked.
  - End-of-Life (EOL) Hardware While some things seem to last forever, the same cannot be said for technology
devices. Improved models regularly supersede these devices. As a result, hardware eventually reaches its end-of-life
(EOL), or the end of its manufacturing lifespan. By this point—preferably sooner—the device should be retired and a
new model installed.
3. End-of-life

| **EOL Risk**                   | **Explanation**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lack of security updates       | Vulnerabilities won't be patched; attacks may succeed without detection         |
| High cost of maintenance       | No firmware upgrades or parts availability, driving up upkeep expenses          |
| Loss of comprehensive security | Aging hardware fails more often, creating gaps that threat actors can exploit   |
| Legal implications             | May violate compliance regulations, leading to fines and legal consequences     |

4. Misconfigurations

| **Configuration**         | **Explanation**                                                                 | **Example**                                                                 |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Default settings          | Vendor defaults prioritize usability over security                             | Router with a widely known default password                                 |
| Open ports and services   | Services often allow broad access by default                                   | Firewall with FTP ports 20 and 21 open                                      |
| Unsecured root accounts   | Root access without safeguards poses high risk                                 | Misconfigured cloud storage granting full data access to any user           |
| Open permissions          | Excessive file privileges expose sensitive data                                | User with Read, Write, Execute privileges instead of just Read              |
| Unsecure protocols        | Communications over outdated, vulnerable protocols                             | Devices using Telnet or SNMPv1                                               |
| Weak encryption           | Encryption algorithms or keys with known vulnerabilities                       | Short or deprecated encryption keys chosen for protection                   |
| Errors                    | Human misconfigurations leading to security issues                             | Choosing outdated or deprecated settings unintentionally                    |

5. Zero-day Vulnerabilities

Security updates are created and distributed when the software developer learns of a vulnerability and corrects it. But
what happens if it is not the developer who uncovers the vulnerability but instead is a threat actor who finds it first?
In this case, attackers can exploit the vulnerability before anyone else even knows it exists. This situation is called a
zero-day vulnerability because there are zero days of warning. Zero-day vulnerabilities are considered extremely seri-
ous because systems are open to attack with no security fixes available.

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Standardized Format
### 🧩 CVE Identifier Format
```shell
CVE-[YEAR]-[NUMBER]
```
- Example: CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell)
- The number is variable-length and expands as needed (e.g., CVE-2025-123456)
### 📦 CVE Record Format (JSON Schema)
The CVE Record Format is defined using a JSON schema maintained by the CVE Program. It ensures consistency across all CVE entries and supports automation. Key fields include:
- cveMetadata: CVE ID, assigner, date
- containers: Includes cnaContainer with:
  - affected: Product name, version, vendor
  - problemTypes: Often mapped to CWE (e.g., CWE-94)
  - references: URLs to advisories, patches, or reports

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS):
### 🧠 What Is CVSS?
CVSS is a standardized framework for rating the severity of software vulnerabilities. It helps security teams prioritize remediation by assigning a score from 0.0 (none) to 10.0 (critical)2.
### 📊 Scoring Components
CVSS uses multiple metric groups to calculate scores:
- Base Metrics (intrinsic to the vulnerability):
  - Attack Vector (AV): Network, adjacent, local, or physical
  - Attack Complexity (AC): Low or high
  - Privileges Required (PR): None, low, or high
  - User Interaction (UI): Required or none
  - Scope (S): Changed or unchanged
  - Impact: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
- Temporal Metrics (change over time):
  - Exploit maturity
  - Remediation level
  - Report confidence
- Environmental Metrics (organization-specific):
  - Importance of CIA (confidentiality, integrity, availability)
  - Modified base metrics
### 🔢 Severity Ratings
### 🎯 CVSS Severity Levels
| Score Range  | Severity |
|--------------|----------|
| 0.0          | None     |
| 0.1–3.9      | Low      |
| 4.0–6.9      | Medium   |
| 7.0–8.9      | High     |
| 9.0–10.0     | Critical |
### 🆕 CVSS v4.0 Highlights
Released in 2023, version 4.0 adds:
- New metrics for IoT/ICS systems
- Supplemental metrics like safety, automation, and recovery effort
- More granular impact scoring for vulnerable vs. subsequent systems
### 🔍 Why It Matters
CVSS provides a common language for vulnerability severity across vendors and tools. It’s widely used in:
- Vulnerability scanners
- Threat advisories
- Patch prioritization workflows

| XDR     | Extended Detection and Response              | Integrates multiple security layers (endpoint, network, cloud, etc.)   |

## 🔍 Feature Comparison
| Feature                | SIEM                                          | SOAR                                  | XDR                                           |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Data Focus**         | Logs and events from across the environment   | Alerts and incident data              | Telemetry from endpoints, cloud, network, etc.|
| **Detection Capabilities** | Basic correlation and rule-based alerts   | Relies on SIEM or other tools         | Advanced analytics and threat detection       |
| **Response Capabilities**  | Manual or limited                         | Automated playbooks and workflows     | Built-in response across integrated tools     |
| **Automation**         | Minimal                                       | High — automates repetitive tasks     | Moderate — some automation, often “SOAR-lite” |
| **Integration Complexity** | High — requires tuning and maintenance    | Medium to high — depends on playbook depth | Medium — native or open integrations          |
| **Use Case Strength**  | Compliance, log management, forensic analysis | Incident response, workflow efficiency | Unified threat detection and rapid response   |
## 🧩 How They Work Together
- SIEM collects and analyzes data to identify potential threats.
- SOAR receives alerts from SIEM and automates the response process.
- XDR can combine elements of both, offering detection and response in one platform — but may lack the depth of SIEM’s analytics or SOAR’s orchestration.

Think of it like this:
- SIEM is the brain 🧠 — gathering and analyzing.
- SOAR is the hands 🤖 — executing responses.
- XDR is the nervous system ⚡ — connecting everything for fast action.

## 🔄 How They Interact
- Configuration Management provides the baseline and visibility needed to assess the impact of changes and patches.
- Change Management governs how and when patches or config updates are applied.
- Patch Management is often a subset of Change Management, especially when patches require downtime or impact services.

# Indicator of Attack (IoA)
There are different “tell-tale” signs regarding an attack. An indicator of attack (IoA) is a sign an attack is currently
underway. This is different from an indicator of compromise (IoC), which is evidence that an attack has already taken
place. Not all attacks will generate these indicators.
| **Indicator**               | **Description**                                                                                                      |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Account lockout             | A user account is inaccessible due to unauthorized access attempts, possibly indicating takeover                    |
| Concurrent session usage    | Both a legitimate user and attacker are logged into the same account simultaneously                                 |
| Blocked content             | Legitimate data or resources become inaccessible, suggesting potential tampering or threat presence                 |
| Impossible travel           | Access from geographically distant locations within unrealistic time frames                                         |
| Resource consumption        | Sudden depletion of system resources like memory or CPU could signal an active attack                              |
| Resource inaccessibility    | Attacks may block access to vital system components or services                                                     |
| Out-of-cycle logging        | Logs generated without corresponding real events, possibly due to manipulation or false activity                    |
| Published/documented        | Verified reports or external evidence highlighting an ongoing or known attack                                       |
| Missing logs                | Log files unexpectedly deleted or altered, indicating possible cover-up efforts during or after an attack           |
