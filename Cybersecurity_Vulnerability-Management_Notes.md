# SIEM vs SOAR vs XDR
## üß† Core Definitions
| Acronym | Full Name                                   | Primary Function                                                        |
|---------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SIEM    | Security Information and Event Management   | Aggregates and analyzes logs to detect and investigate security events |
| SOAR    | Security Orchestration, Automation & Response | Automates responses and coordinates tools for incident management     |
| XDR     | Extended Detection and Response              | Integrates multiple security layers (endpoint, network, cloud, etc.)   |

## üîç Feature Comparison
| Feature                | SIEM                                          | SOAR                                  | XDR                                           |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Data Focus**         | Logs and events from across the environment   | Alerts and incident data              | Telemetry from endpoints, cloud, network, etc.|
| **Detection Capabilities** | Basic correlation and rule-based alerts   | Relies on SIEM or other tools         | Advanced analytics and threat detection       |
| **Response Capabilities**  | Manual or limited                         | Automated playbooks and workflows     | Built-in response across integrated tools     |
| **Automation**         | Minimal                                       | High ‚Äî automates repetitive tasks     | Moderate ‚Äî some automation, often ‚ÄúSOAR-lite‚Äù |
| **Integration Complexity** | High ‚Äî requires tuning and maintenance    | Medium to high ‚Äî depends on playbook depth | Medium ‚Äî native or open integrations          |
| **Use Case Strength**  | Compliance, log management, forensic analysis | Incident response, workflow efficiency | Unified threat detection and rapid response   |
## üß© How They Work Together
- SIEM collects and analyzes data to identify potential threats.
- SOAR receives alerts from SIEM and automates the response process.
- XDR can combine elements of both, offering detection and response in one platform ‚Äî but may lack the depth of SIEM‚Äôs analytics or SOAR‚Äôs orchestration.

Think of it like this:
- SIEM is the brain üß† ‚Äî gathering and analyzing.
- SOAR is the hands ü§ñ ‚Äî executing responses.
- XDR is the nervous system ‚ö° ‚Äî connecting everything for fast action.

## Sumo Logic vs Microsoft Sentinel
### üõ°Ô∏è What They Have in Common
Both Sumo Logic and Azure Sentinel are:
- Cloud-native SIEM platforms.
- Designed for real-time threat detection, log management, and security analytics.
- Equipped with machine learning and automation features to streamline incident response.
### üîç Key Differences
| Feature             | Sumo Logic                                         | Azure Sentinel                                           |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|

## üîÑ How They Interact
- Configuration Management provides the baseline and visibility needed to assess the impact of changes and patches.
- Change Management governs how and when patches or config updates are applied.
- Patch Management is often a subset of Change Management, especially when patches require downtime or impact services.
