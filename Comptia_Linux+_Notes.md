# CompTIA Linux+ Exam XK0-005
# 1.0 System Management
## 1.1 Summarize Linux fundamentals
### 📁 Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)
Linux organizes files by function in specific directories:
- `/boot` – Bootloader files (e.g. GRUB, kernels)
- `/proc` – Virtual filesystem exposing kernel & process info
- `/sys` – Interface to kernel devices and hardware
- `/var` – Variable data like logs and mail
- `/usr` – User utilities and applications
- `/lib` – Shared system libraries
- `/dev` – Device files (block & character devices)
- `/etc` – System configuration files
- `/opt` – Optional third-party software
- `/bin`, `/sbin` – Essential binaries (user & root)
- `/home` – User directories
- `/media`, `/mnt` – Mount points for external storage
- `/root` – Root user’s home
- `/tmp` – Temporary files
### 🧃 Basic Boot Process
Steps that bring Linux to life:
- **BIOS/UEFI** – Firmware initialization and boot device selection
- **Bootloader** – GRUB2 loads kernel & initrd
- **Kernel** – vmlinuz is the compressed Linux kernel
- **Initrd/initramfs** – Temporary root filesystem for early boot
#### 🔧 Boot Commands
- `mkinitrd` / `dracut` – Create initial RAM disk
- `grub2-install` – Install GRUB2
- `grub2-mkconfig` / `grub2-update` – Generate/update GRUB config
#### 🌀 Boot Sources
- **PXE** – Network boot via BIOS/UEFI
- **USB** – Bootable flash drives
- **ISO** – Disk image boot via virtual media
#### 💥 Kernel Panic
System crash due to unrecoverable kernel error—usually visible during boot or hardware issues.
### ⚙️ /dev Device Types
- **Block devices** – Data in blocks (e.g., hard drives)
- **Character devices** – Data stream (e.g., keyboards)
- **Special**:
  - `/dev/null` – Bit bucket (discard output)
  - `/dev/zero` – Infinite zeros
  - `/dev/urandom` – Pseudo-random data
### 🔨 Package Compilation (from Source)
Typical 3-step build:
```bash
./configure
make
make install
```
## 1.2 Given a scenario, manage files and directories
This section outlines key Linux tools and commands for working with files and directories across various scenarios.
